# Cupcake Smash

Welcome to our #IWDCodingChallenge tutorial!

The She Codes team have collaborated with Robert Walters Group to bring you this fun (short) tutorial to give you a coding taster.

In this tutorial you will use a programming language called JavaScript to create a simple game called 'Cupcake Smash' - because at She Codes we firmly believe that coding is ALWAYS better with cupcakes!
