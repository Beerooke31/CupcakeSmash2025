# All Finished!

Congratulations, you now have a fully functioning game that you can share with your friends, family and colleagues. We'd love it if you could tag us if you share it on social media so we can see your creations, and encourage others to try their hand at programming too. You can use the hashtags #IWDCodingChallenge and #ChooseToChallenge, and tag Robert Walters Group & She Codes.

Your coding journey doesn't have to stop here - JavaScript is an immensely powerful coding language and there are dozens of ways you could customise or improve your game with a little help from Google & a few hours of trial and error. Here are some suggestions for ways to make the game your own:

## Style it baby
If you already understand a little HTML & CSS, you can add some of your own styling, or even a tagline with your name to your game so that everyone who sees it knows who the creator was! You could also add some additional animation to the 'smash' (clicking on the cupcake) with some kind of explosion or graphic.

## Next Level
Why stop at 10 seconds? You could create multiple levels with variations each time. For example, you might increase the speed each round so that it becomes harder and harder. You could set a 'minimum score' that the user needs to beat to pass the level!

## Variable Scoring
You might have noticed that there are different cupcakes that display - you could randomise which cupcake shows each time, and give the different cupcakes a different number of points each. You could also introduce decoys - maybe you lose points if you accidentally click a donut instead of a cupcake!

However you customise your game, we hope you've enjoyed learning with She Codes. You can view [our growing list of free tutorials here](https://shecodes.com.au/tutorials) if you'd like to try your hand at something else. If you'd like to dig deeper into what you can do with JavaScript, we love [the free Mozilla Tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript#tutorials).

Good luck, coder!
