# Don't stop!

But your coding journey doesn’t have to stop here - JavaScript is an immensely powerful coding language and there are dozens of ways you could customise or improve your game.

Try out some of our suggestions below or add your own coding flair.

## Style it baby

If you already understand a little HTML & CSS, you can add some of your own styling, or even a tagline with your name to your game so that everyone who sees it knows who the creator was! You could also add some additional animation to the 'smash' (clicking on the diamond) with some kind of explosion or graphic.

## Next Level

Why stop at 10 seconds? You could create multiple levels with variations each time. For example, you might increase the speed each round so that it becomes harder and harder. You could set a 'minimum score' that the user needs to beat to pass the level!

## Variable Scoring

You might have noticed that there are different diamonds that display - you could randomise which diamond shows each time, and give the different diamonds a different number of points each. You could also introduce decoys - maybe you lose points if you accidentally click a different gem instead of a diamond!

However you customise your game, we hope you've enjoyed learning with She Codes. You can view [our growing list of free tutorials here](https://shecodes.com.au/tutorials) if you'd like to try your hand at something else.

Good luck, coder!
