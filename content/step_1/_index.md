# What we're doing
We're building a game called Cupcake Smash using a programming language called Javascript.

To build Cupcake Smash, we're using an online tool called CodePen, which is a platform that makes it easy to build and experiment with front end code (specifically HTML, CSS and JavaScript) right in your browser - without needing to download or set up any special software. You will need a CodePen account to build your own game, but luckily it's free to signup.

We're giving you a 'template' we've put together to get you started which has most of the game elements and styles already set up - we just need to write the JavaScript to get it working! To create your own copy of the game to work with that you can share with others or come back to later, click the **Fork** button in the bottom right corner in CodePen. If you don't already have an account (or aren't signed in) it will prompt you to sign up/in so that you can edit the game. Once you've done that, we're ready to get started!
