# What we're doing
We're building a game called Cupcake Smash using a programming language called Javascript.

To build Cupcake Smash, we're using an online tool called CodePen, which is a platform that makes it easy to build and experiment with front end code (specifically HTML, CSS and JavaScript) right in your browser - without needing to download or set up any special software. You will need a CodePen account to build your own game, but luckily it's free to signup.

We're giving you a 'template' we've put together to get you started which has most of the game elements and styles already set up - we just need to write the JavaScript to get it working! To create your own copy of the game to work with that you can share with others or come back to later, click the **Fork** button in the bottom right corner in CodePen. If you don't already have an account (or aren't signed in) it will prompt you to sign up/in so that you can edit the game. Once you've done that, we're ready to get started!

Once you have your own fork of the template in CodePen, we can start adding our JavaScript code. The way that CodePen works is very simple, and allows us to add code in the area on the right hand side which will then be implemented in the main section (with the purple background). We've purposely minimised the HTML & CSS (content and styling) for you so that today you can focus on learning your way around JavaScript. If you'd like to see the HTML code that was used to create the page you can see at the moment, you can resize the 'HTML' window and see the basic structure of the content.
