# What we're doing

To build Cupcake Smash, we're using a tool called CodePen, which is a platform that makes it easy to build and experiment with front end code (specifically HTML, CSS and JavaScript). You will need an account to build your own game, but it's free to signup.

We've given you something to get started ([Cupcake Smash Starter](https://codepen.io/shecodesaus/pen/yLVpoPX/right?editors=0010)), this has most of the game elements and styles set up, we just need to write the JavaScript to get it working. To create your own copy of the game to work with, click the **Fork** button in the bottom right corner, if you don't already have an account (or aren't signed in) it will prompt you to sign up/in so that you can edit the game. Once you've done that, we're ready to get started!
